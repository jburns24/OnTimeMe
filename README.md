# OnTimeMe

Execute this script from ontimeme home directory: 
```run_me_first```
<br />
<br />
If you run into 401 error, this means you need to uninstall the app package that you had install in your device or emulator before you had run the run_me_first script.
<br />
<br />
To uninstall the old app package run the command: ```adb uninstall com.ontimemeapp.ontimemeapp```.
